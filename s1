Note: checking out 'origin/master'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at 007c0a4 Initial commit



Trafalgar Square at night is silent and almost empty,
 the usual crowds of noisy tourists visiting London replaced by clusters of homeless people,
 who wait on the steps of the National Gallery for food to be distributed.
 But these are not all long-term rough sleepers: central London is seeing a surge of newly
 unemployed restaurant and pub workers forced to sleep on the streets because they can no longer afford to pay rent.
